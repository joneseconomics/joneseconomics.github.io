## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in connecting economic theory to real-world applications. My courses emphasize:

1. **Applied Learning** - Using case studies, simulations, and real data to illustrate economic concepts
2. **Technology Integration** - Incorporating blockchain, data analytics, and AI tools into the curriculum
3. **Global Perspective** - Leading study abroad programs to provide international economic experiences
4. **Industry Connections** - Bringing practitioners and entrepreneurs into the classroom
