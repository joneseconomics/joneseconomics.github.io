## Nonprofit Executive Compensation Benchmarking

I provide **Executive Director Compensation Benchmark Reports** for nonprofit organizations.

### Why This Matters

Nonprofit board members face personal liability if they approve excessive executive compensation. Under IRS Section 4958, boards can establish a **rebuttable presumption of reasonableness** by documenting that they relied on appropriate comparability data when setting compensation. This report provides that data.

### What You Get

A comprehensive, board-ready PDF report that includes:

- **Peer Comparison**: Your ED's compensation compared to 50 similar national organizations and 20 local peers
- **Cost-of-Living Adjustment**: Regional Price Parity adjustments for fair geographic comparisons
- **Statistical Analysis**: Regression modeling and percentile rankings
- **Trend Analysis**: 3-year growth trends for your organization
- **Visual Summaries**: Easy-to-understand charts and gauges
- **Reasonableness Determination**: Clear assessment of whether compensation can be presumed reasonable
